work in progress of my vulkan engine/renderer/whatever based on an awesome book 3D Graphics Rendering Cookbook: A comprehensive guide to exploring rendering algorithms in modern OpenGL and Vulkan  by Sergey Kosarevsky and Viktor Latypov

wont be explaining much, the build is straightforward using cmake, I do need to clean up some things like why does the glm is out there

anyway if you are keen to try download the glTF sample assets by khronos and some hdr images, might need to change all the paths as they are an absolute path

this works on my machine :)
